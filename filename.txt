Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall;
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put Humpty together again.

The major portion of the Indian subcontinent was under British rule from 1857 to 1947. The impact of economic, 
political and social development during this period helped the gradual rise of the Indian independence movement to gain independence from foreign rule. 
After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the direct rule of the British crown was established. When the Constitution of India came into force on 26 January 1950, 
it repealed the Indian Independence Act. India ceased to be a dominion of the British Crown and became a sovereign democratic republic. 26 November 1949 is also known as National Law Day. 
The Indian constitution is the world's longest constitution. At the time of commencement, the constitution had 395 articles in 22 parts and 8 schedules. 
It consists of almost 80,000 words and took 2 years 11 months and 18 days to build.

In the United Kingdom the office of the Secretary of State for India was the authority through whom Parliament exercised its rule (along with the Council of India), 
and established the office of Viceroy of India (along with an Executive Council in India, consisting of high officials of the British Government). 
The Indian Councils Act 1861 provided for a Legislative Council consisting of the members of the Executive council and non-official members. 
The Indian Councils Act 1892 established provincial legislatures and increased the powers of the Legislative Council. 
Although these Acts increased the representation of Indians in the government, their power still remained limited. 
The Indian Councils Act 1909 and the Government of India Act 1919 further expanded participation of Indians in the government.
